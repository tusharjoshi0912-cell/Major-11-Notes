                            The maturity and sophistication of a scientific discipline are often judged by how extensively it uses mathematics. However, it's a common misconception that mathematics is itself an empirical science. It isn't. Mathematics is a <strong class="text-[#005f73]">formal, logical, symbolic system</strong>—an intricate game built upon signs, symbols, and a strict set of rules for their manipulation. It doesn't conduct experiments to discover truths about the natural world.

                            <p>The virtue that makes mathematics more than trivial is its capacity to serve as a model for events and relations in the empirical world.</p>

                         <p class="mt-4 text-[#d8f3dc]">This power to mirror reality is what elevates mathematics from a mere abstract exercise into an indispensable tool for science. It provides a structured language to describe and predict the workings of the universe.</p>

                            Measurement is not just a tool, but a central goal, especially in experimental psychology and psychophysics. While it remains a distant aspiration in fields exploring uncharted human complexities, it is the immediate objective where variables have been carefully disentangled.

If a fish was stolen, they could discover the theft by pairing each remaining fish against a pebble and finding one pebble left over.

                            The invention of ordered numerals was a monumental achievement. But once the concept existed, how should the numbers be written? Creating a unique symbol for every single number is a theoretical possibility, but it is a <strong class="font-semibold text-[#ca6702]">"psychological suicide."</strong> The human brain simply cannot store and recall an infinite, unstructured list of symbols. The cognitive load would be overwhelming.

But because irrational numbers fit into the formal rules of arithmetic, they pay their way as useful, law-abiding tenants of the realm.</p>

The Greeks even had a word for it: <strong class="font-semibold">"unexpressible."</strong> This term tells us better than the Latin-derived "irrational" that these ratios are not contrary to reason but are merely undepictable by integers.</p>

We are told that members of the order were sworn to secrecy not to reveal them to outsiders. As Dantzig quotes Proclos: <strong class="font-semibold">"It is told that those who first brought out the irrationals from concealment into the open perished in shipwreck, to a man."</strong></p>

In other words, a relation is connected if it holds between <strong class="font-semibold">all pairs of items</strong> in a specified field. Connected relations are necessary (but not sufficient) to the arrangement of things in a series.</p>

                        <p>It is an interesting exercise to think up examples and to assign them their proper attributes. In so doing, remember that it is essential to specify the <strong class="font-semibold">"field" of the relation</strong>, i.e., the class of things related—whether natural numbers, real numbers, all people, some people, triangles, etc.—before a proper assignment can be made.</p>

                        Since the business of setting things in rank order is important to many psychological inquiries, let us consider how we might characterize linear order by a set of formal assumptions. These assumptions, or postulates as they are often called, are due to Huntington. When we make them, we are laying down the conditions—the "demands"—that any system must satisfy if it is to be classed as ordered. The word "postulate" is from the Latin <em class="italic">postulare</em>, meaning "to demand."

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                        First we introduce a symbol, $<$, and we leave it completely undefined. It may stand for any one of a number of relations, e.g., less than, precedes, older than, or above. We also make use of the symmetrical relations expressed by the symbol $\ne$, meaning "is different from."

                        Let us now take a moment to discuss the business of postulation. Since postulates are merely the assumptions we make about relations, it is clear that initially they are very easy to come by. As Russell said when he was scolding those who postulate that an irrational number is the limit of the sequence of fractions that approach it, "The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil" (1920, p. 71).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                        But whether postulation is thievery depends upon the circumstances. Russell objects to the process only when it is used to dodge a problem that honest toil could solve. In setting up the initial postulates of a mathematical system we are not trying to duck a difficulty; we are trying to pare away the irrelevant nonessentials in order to get a clear view of what constitutes the essence of the system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        Generally, we want to see how few notions we can leave undefined and still generate all the propositions and theorems of the system. Consequently, there are criteria that are applied to postulates in order to prove their fitness to serve. The most important of these criteria are <strong class="text-[#ca6702]">consistency, independence, and sufficiency</strong>. The first of these is a must, while the other two are in a sense optional.

                            Consistency is demonstrated if a system in which there are no known contradictions can be shown to fit the postulates. The postulates of order are consistent because systems like the natural numbers and the points on a line satisfy them, provided the proper interpretation is made of the symbol $<$.

                        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                            Independence means that no one of the postulates can be derived from the others. The requirement of independence is not logically essential, because mere duplication or partial overlap among postulates does not invalidate the system they govern. However, independence is economically and esthetically desirable, as it furthers the cause of elegance.

                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">
                            You can test the independence of the postulates of order by thinking up interpretations of the symbol $<$ for which some one of the postulates is false while the others are true. Begin, for example, by letting $<$ mean "is the ancestor of."

                        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                            Sufficiency is a property that may or may not be required of a set of postulates, depending on our purpose. It refers to the ability of the postulates to determine a single system, as opposed to several systems that are not mutually isomorphic. Two systems are isomorphic if the elements of one system can be paired off one-to-one with the elements of the other system. It turns out that the postulates of order are not sufficient to determine a single system.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                            For example, these postulates can be satisfied by a finite set of integers (e.g., the numbers from 1 to 10) and by the infinite set of all integers. Obviously, these two sets cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
                            In contrast with the postulates of order, the fundamental postulates of algebra are sufficient to determine a single system. In this connection it is probably in order to call attention to a general principle: the negation of one of the postulates governing a system has the effect of making the system more general.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
                            In other words, it becomes easier to find instances that satisfy the postulates when their number is limited. Thus, we have already seen how the suppression of the commutative law makes it possible to add quaternions to the number system. Another celebrated example is the creation of the numerous non-Euclidean geometries within the amplified elbow room of a curtailed set of postulates (e.g., a set in which the postulate of parallels is suppressed).

                        It is a curious fact that, although the postulational method was applied to geometry two millennia ago, only in modern times were the fundamental assumptions of algebra exhumed from the hodgepodge of rules by which algebraic manipulations are carried out. These basic postulates thus represent the distilled wisdom of more than 3000 years of algebraic juggling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                        It should be pointed out at once that there is, strictly speaking, no one algebra—there are several. There is at least one for each major division of the number domain. In a certain sense all these algebras are included in the algebra of complex numbers, which is in many respects simpler than any of the more restricted algebras. The postulates of complex algebra as framed by Huntington are consistent, independent, and sufficient, and they are 27 in number, which means that we will not list them here.

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        Instead we shall have a look at the postulates of ordinary algebra which Harkin sets forth in a scheme having a certain mnemonic merit. All that need be remembered is the word <strong class="text-[#ca6702]">"SCARED,"</strong> which the student of algebra will find quite natural.

                        First we assume a class or set of elements, a, b, c,... This class is ordered—it obeys the three postulates listed above. Next we assume two operations denoted by + and X, and finally we impose on these symbols the conditions listed in the table below.

                        Out of these postulates we get the theorems of algebra. All the complicated propositions that fill the treatises on real algebra stem from this set of simple statements, and all the algebraic theorems can be reduced to the postulates S.C.A.R.E.D. Harkin shows how the elementary rules of cancellation, transposition, etc.—the rules we learn in high school—follow directly from these basic assumptions. These rules appear as theorems, derivable from the table above.

                        These distinctions are not always preserved, and many statements have the appearance of empirical propositions when they are really definitions, leading to much confusion.

                        The definitions here are arbitrary conventions for our use of words. Having defined "cat" and "instinct" arbitrarily, we can then compose empirical propositions like the hypothesis, whose validity is a matter to be tested by observation. It is astonishing how frequently we generate pseudo-problems by confusing these statements.

                                The main difference is that empirical considerations enter the scientific method. In science, we can test our deductions against nature. In mathematics, the facts of the natural universe are irrelevant. We cannot prove algebra with test tubes.

                                A deduction in science consists in a transformation of a sentence in accordance with syntactical rules. When the hypothesis is an equation, the procedure is clear. When the hypothesis is in English, the rules are less explicit, but a logic is being used nonetheless.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-sm mt-4 text-[#d8f3dc]">
                                Fortunately for the future of theory building in the nonquantitative reaches of science, the formalization of logic into a symbolic calculus is presently proceeding apace. This modern logic "provides explicit techniques for manipulating the most basic ingredients of discourse. Its yield for science may be expected to consist also in a contribution of rigor and clarity - a sharpening of the concepts of science" (Quine, p. 8). The well-read psychologist of the future may need to know both Russian and some universal language or pasigraphy like symbolic logic.

                        Let us return now to some further matters in what Russell likes to call the philosophy of mathematics, as opposed to its practice as an art. As we dig downward toward the lower strata of the subject in order to discover what notions are fundamental, we turn up, as we have already seen, some very simple but powerful ideas. The obviousness of some of these concepts does not detract from their importance.

                        Two of the most fundamental concepts of mathematics have already been alluded to. They are the notion of a <span class="font-semibold text-[#005f73]">class of elements</span> and the notion of <span class="font-semibold text-[#005f73]">one-to-one correspondence</span> or <span class="font-semibold text-[#005f73]">isomorphism</span>. A third concept is that of a <span class="font-semibold text-[#0a9396]">mathematical group</span>, and a fourth is the closely related concept of <span class="font-semibold text-[#ca6702]">invariance</span>. We shall first try to understand what the mathematician means by a group.

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        The theory of groups is little more than a century old, but it has already illuminated much of what goes on in geometry and algebra. Perhaps the theory is not the "Open sesame" it was thought to be in its heyday when the demonstration that a given theory obeyed the postulates of a group was considered a momentous accomplishment. Nevertheless, the group is a very basic notion and one that we shall have use for when we consider the problem of devising scales of measurement.

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        A group in mathematics is a set of operations. The thing that makes these operations a group is the fact that one operation followed by another operation produces a result that is the same as what could have been produced by one or more different operations. This, of course, is a loose definition, and we will need to take up the slack as soon as we consider an example.
                    </p>

                        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-2">
                            Take the batting order of a baseball team. There are nine players arranged in a sequence. A manager can change the order by interchanging (permuting) players. Any one of the 362,880 possible orders could be achieved by successively substituting one player for another.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                            For instance, to move the lead-off man to the fourth position, you could make three successive one-for-one substitutions. To get the clean-up man back to the first position, you could make two more substitutions. These five separate substitutions produce the same batting order as a single interchange of the first and fourth players would have. This shows that some combinations of operations are equivalent to other combinations of operations.

                        This always impresses the layman as a trivial and obvious matter, and he is astonished to learn that this simple notion, basic to the theory of permutation groups, was essential to Galois' solution of a long-standing riddle about the solvability of equations. These simple permutation groups even turn up in modern descriptions of atomic structure.

                        In the special case when an operation `a` followed by `b` is the same as `b` followed by `a` (a ∘ b = b ∘ a), the group is called <span class="text-[#0a9396] font-semibold">commutative</span>, or <span class="text-[#0a9396] font-semibold">Abelian</span>, named after the mathematician Abel. With this commutative postulate imposed, the group's rules look very much like the postulates of ordinary algebra. The distributive law is not needed to determine a group, Abelian or otherwise.

                                The set of all real numbers forms an Abelian group with respect to the process of addition. The combination symbol in the group postulates becomes the <span class="text-[#0a9396] font-semibold">+</span> sign. The numbers themselves can be seen as the elements or operations.

The <span class="text-[#ca6702] font-semibold">inverse element</span> for any number `a` is -a, because a + (-a) = 0.

                        Many different kinds of operations form groups. There are groups of permutations on batting orders, on electrons, or on any other arrangements of things. There are also groups of rotations of objects in space, like those of a wheel with six spokes.

                            Each rotation of a wheel by 60 degrees leaves the space it occupies <span class="text-[#0a9396] font-semibold">unchanged (invariant)</span>. These 60-degree rotations form a finite group where a 360-degree rotation is the identity operation of no rotation at all. On the other hand, all possible motions of a rigid body in space generate an infinite continuous group.

                        From the point of view of measurement, the most interesting groups are those whose elements are algebraic transformations. The simple act of multiplying by a constant, as we do when converting inches to feet, belongs to the <span class="text-[#ca6702] font-semibold">similarity group</span>. When this operation is applied, the property that is preserved (invariant) is the <span class="text-[#ca6702] font-semibold">ratios among distances</span>.

In the paragraphs above, it has carried two different meanings: it has stood both for a <span class="text-[#005f73] font-semibold">mathematical manipulation</span> (e.g., multiplying) and for a <span class="text-[#0a9396] font-semibold">concrete empirical act</span> (e.g., rotating a wheel).

                            These two enterprises belong to different realms: one is formal and abstract, while the other is a physical procedure. The use of the same word is deeply ingrained in our language, so we must simply remember that an operation in mathematics can serve as a model for a physical event, but they are not the same thing.

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        In general, we enlarge the reach of invariance by exploring the effects of parameters. For example, we might start with a tonal threshold and find, for a given frequency, the intensity that can be heard. That is an invariant point.
                    </p>
                    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-[#ee9b00] my-6">
                        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                            Then we can vary another dimension, like the duration of the tone, and construct a three-dimensional surface that gives the threshold invariance under three parameters. Age of the listener, degree of the subject's training, and so on, might be a fourth or fifth parameter.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        As we extend this process, we encroach more and more on the no-man's land of what is usually pigeonholed in the catchall called variability. While variability is never banished from empirical science, successive expansions of the domain of invariance can reduce its dominion to tractable proportions.

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        Consider the intelligence quotient—the IQ. Why is this such a capital concept in psychology and education? It's not its value at a single moment, but the fact that it stays relatively constant throughout the growing years.
                    </p>
                    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 items-start mt-6">
                        <div>
                            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                In this respect, the IQ is analogous to the concept of the <span class="text-[#ca6702] font-semibold">somatotype</span>—the designation of human morphology by means of three variables whose values determine the basic character of a given physique.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-[#005f73]">
                            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                                The apparent invariance of the somatotype under the transformation we call "aging" makes this notion potentially useful. Some degree of invariance is requisite to the importance of both the IQ and the somatotype. The wider their limits of invariance, the more useful they become.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed italic mt-6">
                        The scientist seeks measures that will stay put while his back is turned. But, needless to say, the greater number of psychological studies seem not to result in the demonstration of significant invariance. It is obviously easy to state that delineating the conditions of invariance for any phenomenon would tell us all we want to know about it, but the experimental task itself is uphill work.
